# Prediciting-patient-condition-using-drug-reviews

Patient narrative data is plentiful in the healthcare industry and often some of the most inaccessible data.  Doctor’s notes have historically been in the form of hand written text in a patient’s chart.  With the advent of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), this data has been digitized and placed in electronic form, however, much of it remains in hard to use, free-text format.

We use online patient reviews of medications to predict the patient’s medical condition.
